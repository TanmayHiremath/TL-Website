      <div class="card-footer">When Shyam Shah built his first simple prototype at Tinkerer’s Lab he was perhaps
        unaware that one day his Braille reading device will become the world’s most affordable, multi-language
        Digital Braille display. Even today 12 million Indians, the worlds largest blind population, are almost
        completely dependent on the braille script perforated on hard paper. Yet, in the modern world, most of
        the resources available are in digital form.
        Put simply, Braille Me is an input and output device wherein the content can be read and typed. You
        could insert a USB drive and this Braille device can read the files. You can pair it via Bluetooth to a
        Smartphone, computer, or tablet. You can also Whatsapp, send emails by typing messages in Braille Me
        which would then get converted into visual English (or another language) characters. The USP of
        BrailleMe is its unique magnetic operated actuators technology that enables them to offer the product at
        a 10x price advantage over competitors.

        begun exploring manufacturing processes, motion mechanization and computer integrated control by
        designing & building machine prototypes at TL from scratch and testing them iteratively to improve them
        further. By 2016 the team had successfully developed a working prototype of square tube profiling
        machine in Tinkerers lab. Today Metalman Automation is a Mumbai based industrial machinery startup
        incubated at SINE IIT Bombay. The company’s machinery and engineering support together gives shop-floors
        the ability to process metal in a way that allows quick completion of projects at a much lower cost.

        projects. Technicians are always around to help with the heavy equipment, helping us push limits of what we can
        build.

        TL's managing team, over the years, has built this encouraging environment, bringing together experienced alumni
        and motivated students. I wish them the best, for the future.</p>

      <p class="lead">I have been using the Tinkerers’ Laboratory since my first year, and I couldn’t be more grateful.
        Every Project that I have worked on has had a portion (or even the entire thing) completed in TL, from
        brainstorming to actual building. It isn’t just the availability of nearly every piece of equipment I needed,
        it’s also the community surrounding the lab. Help and guidance is there whenever I need it.</p>

      <p class="lead">Tinkerers’ Lab (aka TL) has been my second home at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (1st
        being my room)! I had heard about the one of a kind student-run 24*7 open lab, Tinkerers’ Lab at Indian
        Institute of Technology, Bombay, before I had entered the Institute. I am a big hardware person and started
        dabbling with power tools and electronics when I was in school. Stepping into TL for the first time was like a
        holy grail of hardware unlocked for me! Looking at a whole bunch of power tools,ranging from electric drill to
        jigsaws and all the electrical and mechanical components in the nicely arranged shelves, I was already having
        ideas floating in my mind on how and what to build! During the first year, TL provided me space and tools to
        build an electric car, an RC plane, and a quadcopter. The 3D printers came in TL during my 2nd year, and I
        couldn’t be more excited to learn more about it. One of my projects involved designing a chemical engineering
        lab experiment, and the 3D printing machine in TL came in handy for printing the necessary parts.My junior year
        in the Institute provided me with an opportunity to contribute to TL and helping it be a platform for speakers
        working in the field of technology to visit and share their knowledge with the students. As a Secretary of the
        Aeromodelling club, I invited speakers working on something as small as toy gliders to leaders in the field of
        commercial aviation. Tinkerers’ Lab also provided me as a platform to promote the spirit of “Social
        Entrepreneurship” in the Institute by initiating “Rural and Agricultural Projects” in association with the CTARA
        department and UNICEF. Looking back, I can say that, Tinkerers’ Lab has not been just a lab with tools but a
        canvas to express me onto it!</p>

      <p class="lead">"At times when I find myself unoccupied, Tinkerers Laboratory is the place where I will be found
        tinkering around with devices or machines. In case I happen to script the story of my institute life in no way
        possible can I keep Tinkerers' Laboratory out of it.

        Tinkerers' Laboratory has a lot to offer. I not only found the resources required to build any project but also
        a great community to interact and tinker around with. The necessity of such a facility was clear to me when I
        had to struggle to get a simple job done while the lab was closed. The kind of freedom I got to get my hand into
        operating various machines and building my ideas into shape has been amazing. If asked for I would describe this
        place as a necessity that must be accessible to growing engineers."/p>

      <p class="lead">Many of my finest memories as an engineer in the institute were made here. Be it pulling out
        all-nighters for XLR8, RC Plane or designing a life follower in my freshmen year, every experience is etched
        very deep in my heart. It’s the closest to a place that allows you to realize that Tinkerer’s image one has in
        his/her mind before setting afoot at IIT Bombay. I have been privileged enough to get an opportunity to serve as
        the secretary for Tinkerers’ Lab and I still cherish the feeling of enabling others to realize the Tinkerer
        within oneself. Tinkerer’s Lab has always played some part in every project be it hobby or academic that I have
        done. It was always fun to have a lab open 24 hours to work on your ideas and I would say Tinkerers’ lab has
        played a key role in my journey to becoming an engineer</p>

      <p class="lead">I remember vividly the first time I went to TL for soldering some connector pins for our RC plane
        in my first semester at IITB, sometime around midnight. I was fascinated to see how a single place in the whole
        of the academic area nearby was buzzing with enthusiastic people all working on something or the other. At that
        time I didn't realise how important a purpose TL was serving, facilitating people to work at any time with
        whatever they want all without any questions asked or permissions required. For me, TL quickly became a go-to
        place whenever I wanted to do any tinkering, a few times even just to chill out. TL not only provided a platform
        for us to work in a free environment but it also facilitated us with our academics. I still remember how for the
        first time in my life I had seen a 3D printer at TL and later the same 3D printer was used to fabricate major
        components of our research project and this is just one example out of many. The carefree environment of TL is
        like the early days of an infant where it just goes about exploring and experiencing everything by putting it in
        its mouth. Similarly, the hands-on learnings and the little mistakes made while tinkering at TL has now seasoned
        us to become confident and successful players professionally. I can continue to write about TL but any number of
        words won't be able to sum up my experience. Tinkerers' Laboratory aka TL is one of the best things to happen to
        IIT Bombay and I hope that it will continue to be the same for IITB and become a role model for others as well.
